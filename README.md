# Website Repository

## This repository builds a GitHub Pages website showcasing my professional profile.
***The working version is currently developed in Spanish, with plans to make it available also in Galician and English.***

- Provides an overview of who I am (/about/), with links to my online profiles.

- Categorises the projects and activities I have been involved in into three groups (/projects/), with harmonised details available through the links.

- Shares my latest portfolio and CV for colleagues, collaborators, and potential employers (/projects/portfolio/ and /cv/).

- Offers channels to get in touch with me for potential collaborations and interactions.
